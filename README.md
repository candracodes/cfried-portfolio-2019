# Candra Fried Portfolio — version 1
The is an older portfolio from 2019 showcasing some of my professional and creative works. I'm proud of the work I was able to create, but my plan was always to revist this design to make it a bit more modern. At present, the images aren't optimized, and as a result... the site has a tendancy to load a bit slower. Nevertheless, this application got the job done for what I needed it for back in 2019: showcasing some samples of my work, getting my resume out there to the masses, and establishing on online footprint.
